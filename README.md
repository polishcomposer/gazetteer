**Functionality**

The application provides profiling for all countries through the presentation of demographic, climatic, geographical and other data.

**Guidelines for the Project**

The specification was to reply to a website specification for a map-based app to provide information on countries – with a focus on a “mobile first” development. Preferably using a framework, to then develop HTML, CSS and JavaScript with JQuery modules that use PHP server-based components to source data from third party APIs (Geonames, OpenWeather). The solution is assessed on its delivery to specification, functionality, and usability.
